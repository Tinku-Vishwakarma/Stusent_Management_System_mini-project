# Stusent_Management_System_mini-project
A Student Management System using Python is a Desktop application designed to manage student data efficiently. It allows users to perform tasks such as adding, updating, and deleting student records, tracking academic performance, managing attendance, and organizing courses. By using Python libraries such as Tkinter (for the interface) and MySQL (for the database), the system enables streamlined access and management of student information, helping educational institutions maintain organized and easily retrievable records.
